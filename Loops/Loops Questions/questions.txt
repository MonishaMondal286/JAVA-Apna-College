7. **What will be the output of the following code?**

   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       System.out.print(i + " ");

### üîÅ **Intermediate Loop Questions**

11. **Write a program using nested `for` loops to print the following pattern:**

    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ```

12. **What will be the output of the following nested loop?**

    ```java
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 2; j++) {
            System.out.print(i + "," + j + " ");
        }
    }
    ```

13. **Write a loop that finds the factorial of a number entered by the user.**

14. **Convert the following `for` loop into a `while` loop:**

    ```java
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        System.out.println(i);
    }
    ```

15. **What is a nested loop? Give a real-world example where nested loops are useful.**


16. **How do you exit from nested loops using `break` with a label? Provide code.**

17. **Write a program that prints only even numbers from 1 to 20 using a loop.**

18. **Write a loop to print the multiplication table of a number entered by the user.**

19. **What is the time complexity of a nested `for` loop, and how can it affect performance?**

20. **Modify a loop to skip printing numbers that are multiples of 3 from 1 to 20 using `continue`.**

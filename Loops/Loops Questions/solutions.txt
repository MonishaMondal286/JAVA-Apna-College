soln.1) while loop, do-while loop and for loop
        while loop ->  while(){
                         //code
                        }
        do-while loop -> do(condition){
                          //code
                        }while();
        for loop --->   for(condition){
                           //code
                         }


soln.4) while --> checks the condition and prints the output
        do-while --> prints output after that checks the condition 

soln.5) does not print a output 

soln.15) loop printed inside another loop

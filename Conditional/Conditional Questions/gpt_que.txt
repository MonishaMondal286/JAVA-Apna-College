### âœ… **Medium-Level Questions (1â€“10)**

1. **Leap Year Check (with edge cases)**
   Write a program to check whether a year is a leap year. Consider the rule: a year is a leap year if divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.

2. **Check if character is vowel or consonant**
   Accept a character and determine whether it's a vowel or consonant. Handle both lowercase and uppercase inputs.

3. **Find the largest among three numbers using nested if-else**
   Take three numbers and print the largest one using only `if` and `else`.

4. **Grading System**
   Input a mark (0â€“100) and print the grade using the following:

   * 90â€“100: A
   * 80â€“89: B
   * 70â€“79: C
   * 60â€“69: D
   * <60: F

5. **Even or Odd without `%` operator**
   Determine if a number is even or odd **without** using the modulus operator.

6. **Check triangle type**
   Input three sides and print whether the triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene.

7. **Check for Armstrong Number (3 digits)**
   Determine if a number is an Armstrong number (e.g., 153 = 1Â³ + 5Â³ + 3Â³).

8. **Check if number lies between two numbers**
   Check if a number is between two others, regardless of the order of the boundaries.

9. **Sign of a number**
   Input a number and print whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

10. **Convert number to day of week using switch**
    1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc. Use `switch`. Handle default case for invalid input.

11. **Nested condition: Voting and driving eligibility**
    Input age and determine if a person can:

* Only vote (18+)
* Only drive (16+)
* Both
* Neither

12. **Check if a year, month, and day make a valid date (non-leap)**
    Input day, month, and year, and verify if it is a valid date.

13. **Login system with username and password (3 attempts)**
    Simulate a simple login system that locks the user out after 3 incorrect attempts.

14. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game logic**
    Take two inputs (Player 1 and Player 2) and determine who wins using `if-else`.

15. **Evaluate mathematical expression based on operator input**
    Input two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) and compute the result using `switch`.

16. **Grade Evaluation with multiple conditions**
    If marks >=90 and attendance >=80 â†’ "Excellent",
    else if marks >=75 â†’ "Good",
    else â†’ "Needs Improvement".

17. **ATM withdrawal logic**
    Check if a user can withdraw based on balance, and ensure balance doesnâ€™t go negative.

18. **Find the quadrant of a point (x, y)**
    Determine which quadrant the point lies in.

19. **Nested switch: Car service menu**
    First choose brand (Toyota, Honda), then choose service (Oil Change, Tire Rotation), and print cost.

20. **Check if a number is a palindrome (using only conditionals)**
    Input a 3 or 4-digit number and check if it's a palindrome using if-else logic.
